Calendar App is an independent project developed by Muhammad Saad to provide a simple and reliable way to organize schedules and deadlines.

Adding Events: Users can create events by entering booking details which are stored and displayed in a clean calendar view.

Managing Events: Events can be viewed by day, week, or month, and updated or removed as needed to keep schedules accurate.

Date Navigation: The date navigation tool in the top right corner allows users to navigate to past and future bookings.
